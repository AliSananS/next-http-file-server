## 🛠 Code Style & Guidelines

* **Formatting:** Use the default Prettier config (`npm run format`)
* **Components:** Use functional components with hooks
* **Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names (`checkFilePermissions` > `cfp`)
* **Types:** Prefer **TypeScript types/interfaces** over `any` (Try defining types in `@/types` directory )
* **UI Consistency:** Stick to the HeroUI design language ([See HeroUI's Design Principles](https://www.heroui.com/docs/guide/design-principles))

## 🚦 PR Review Process

1. Your PR will be reviewed for **functionality, code quality, and UI consistency and breaking changes**.
2. You may get feedback — please address it before merging.
3. Once approved, it will be merged into `main`.

## 💡 Ideas for Contribution

* Bug fixes
* New file manager features (search, sort, filters, visual, animations, authentication, users)
* UI/UX improvements
* Documentation

---

## ⚠️ Please Avoid

* Large, unrelated changes in a single Pull Request (Try 1 or a few changes per PR)
* Adding unnecessary dependencies
* Over-complicating and bloating the UI with excessive animations
